## 2.1 Method used

  During the industrial talk, we conducted the interactive method which is the Q&A method, where we engage with the interviewer to get immediate feedback. This method was the most practical since there was a Q&A session after the talk given by Mr. Ahmad. Besides, we also conducted another method which is the online interview through messaging apps.
Through this method, we are able to gather real-time responses and clarify any questions that we might have missed during the hybrid industrial talk session. By utilizing both of these methods, we were able to gather essential information for our report documentation. 

  To prepare the questions beforehand, we also refer to the questionnaire structures to decide the flow of how we want to interview Mr. Ahmad. In the end, we chose the pyramid structure to familiarize Mr. Ahmad with the general topic of our question before moving into open-ended questions so that we could collect the data that we needed.
