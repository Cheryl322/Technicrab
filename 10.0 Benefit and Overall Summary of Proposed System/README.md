  After this report documentation, we showed that the proposed system can redefine the way the existing system is supposed to be used. As the current system is re-digitized, this new proposed system will improve not only the userâ€™s overall experience but also the administrator's. The new system will definitely provide a more streamlined method for the user to submit and view their application, hence saving their precious time in the process as they are no longer required to do it physically in their agency office. Moreover, the new key features proposed such as the live chat function and login security function can greatly improve the usability and the security aspects, offering a more comfortable and reliable experience.

  In conclusion, this proposed system will significantly improve the user experience and administrative process. Not only does it save a massive amount of time, but also improves the overall interaction process and bolsters security measures. We hope that the proposed system is able to satisfy them by meeting the basic requirements to ensure continued usage of this new system. This system represents a significant step forward in modernizing and optimizing operations, ultimately setting a new standard for efficiency and convenience in the industry.
