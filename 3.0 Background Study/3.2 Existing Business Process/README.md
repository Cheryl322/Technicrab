## 3.2 Existing Business Process

The current system is a manual process that is not that efficient and productive. However, it includes a few key services and features, as listed below:

  1. Membership Registration
This is a structured process for staff to become members, granting them access to a variety of cooperative benefits and services.

The existing system for member registration is manual, requiring information to be filled out on printed forms. In the registration process, most of the personal information, including name, IC number, address, and so on will be collected. The registration paper is then reviewed again by KADA staff. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and burdensome on human resources.
