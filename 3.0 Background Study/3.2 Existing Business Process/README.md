## 3.2 Existing Business Process

The current system is a manual process that is not that efficient and productive. However, it includes a few key services and features, as listed below:

1. Membership Registration

This is a structured process for staff to become members, granting them access to a variety of cooperative benefits and services.

The existing system for member registration is manual, requiring information to be filled out on printed forms. In the registration process, most of the personal information, including name, IC number, address, and so on will be collected. The registration paper is then reviewed again by KADA staff. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and burdensome on human resources.

2. Loan Applications

Financial support through loans for personal, educational, or business purposes. The loan application process aims to be straightforward and efficient, enabling cooperative members to secure the necessary funds promptly. The existing system for loan applications is also manual, requiring information to be filled out on printed forms.

3.0 Member Financial Statements

Koperasi Kakitangan KADA Kelantan Berhad currently uses a manual system for generating and distributing member financial statements. This involves collecting financial data manually from various records and compiling it into individual member statements. These statements include details such as the member's name, IC number, shares held, loans taken, and savings.

Once the statements are prepared, they are reviewed by staff to ensure accuracy. After verification, the statements are handed out to members. Members then sign and return the verification portion to confirm receipt and accuracy.
This manual process is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to errors due to manual data entry. It also places a significant burden on the cooperative's limited human resources and delays members' access to their financial information. Implementing an automated system would streamline this process, reduce staff workload, and provide members with timely and accurate financial information.
