  In this project, we are collaborating with Lembaga Kemajuan Pertanian Kemubu, an agency working under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. Their mission is to promote the economic and social progress of farmers in the Kemubu region. Our client, Koperasi Kakitangan KADA Kelantan Berhad, operates as a subsidiary of this agency. For inquiries, both our client and the agency can be reached at 609-7447088. Our interview was with Mr. Ahmad Rohailin bin Hani, who holds a key role.

  Currently, the cooperative uses a paper-based process for member registration, loan applications, and member financial statement issuance. Therefore, implementing a new system for the company will be crucial in reducing the burden on human resources and enhancing overall efficiency.
