## 7.0 Scope of the Project

In our system, there will be 4 types of users including the admin, board director, member and new user. Each user type is capable of performing specific actions within the system. However, certain limitations will differentiate what actions can or cannot be done on the system by the users. For instance, the system allows the admin to update the dividend payment annually, but the specific payment calculations and corporate payment methods are beyond the system's scope. These limitations establish the system's boundaries and define its capabilities.

First and foremost, for the new user and members' insight, new users could join the cooperation by registering an account through their website. On the other hand, users who are interested in applying for a loan from the corporation could apply to become their members. Members can fill out their registration forms online through their website instead of filling out the paper forms manually.  Personal and sensitive information will be securely stored in a digital database, minimizing security risks and ensuring easy retrieval and management of data. The system will automatically verify the information provided, reducing the time and effort required for manual verification by staff.

Besides, members who applied for the loan could always follow up on their current status through the website we created. In detail, Members are able to check the status of their registration, loan applications, and payments in real-time through our online portal. The system will automatically send email and SMS notifications to members regarding the status of their applications and payments, ensuring timely and efficient communication. In addition, the financial statements will be generated and distributed digitally, allowing members to access their financial information anytime, anywhere. The system will maintain comprehensive and up-to-date financial status, providing members with detailed insights into their investments, loans, and other financial activities.

Furthermore, our system also is prepared for the admin, and staff of the cooperation to update the status as I had explained in the last paragraph. The admin needs to transfer the result of the approval of any application that is decided and given by the board director and inform the members through the website we implemented. The admin does not need to send the emails one by one to the members manually, they could just set the status of the application in our system, and an automated notification will be sent to all the members via the platform. This way, the process becomes more efficient and less time-consuming for the admin and staff. Additionally, the admin could now track all of the applications, member's information and their statuses easily, providing a clear overview of the progress to both the admin and the members.

Lastly, as for the board director, they could login to our website to edit the webpage and make any necessary changes or updates. This access allows the board director to keep the webpage current and relevant to the cooperation activities and initiatives. By logging in, they can also communicate important messages to the website visitors, ensuring that the online presence reflects the latest information and developments. The board director can also do what an admin does. They could also update the status and retrieve the information or track membersâ€™ status on the website. It empowers the board director to contribute directly to the website and maintain a dynamic platform for engaging with the members.

Upon reviewing our system scope, a restriction arises that restricts access to external users. They are unable to navigate through the system. Our website can only be accessed by the four specified entities mentioned earlier. Additionally, there are constraints regarding payments, as we can only receive final statements instead of managing the payment system, which is overseen by the banks and not within our system scope. Considering these system scopes and limitations, they play a crucial role in defining and developing a well-designed system.
