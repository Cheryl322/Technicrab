## 5.1 Technical Feasibility

We will assess the current IT infrastructure to support our upcoming system. First, we need to create a virtual login and registration web page for users, so we should evaluate the software and hardware requirements for introducing the automated system. For instance, we use the design tool Figma for our software tool and UI/UX design to ensure a user-friendly interface. Below is a table of the minimum hardware requirements.

It is also crucial to check the compatibility of the new system with current systems and processes to ensure a seamless transition. Furthermore, we will also need to evaluate our network infrastructure to ensure it can handle the increased traffic and data loads anticipated with the new system. In summary, this preparation will help us effectively implement the new system.
