## 5.0 Proposed Solution

In order to address the inefficiencies and challenges posed by the current manual system at Koperasi Kakitangan KADA Kelantan Berhad, we propose implementing a comprehensive, automated system. This new system will enhance efficiency, security, and overall user experience by introducing several key features and improvements:

  1. Automated Member Registration:

  Members can fill out their registration forms online, reducing the need for         paper-based processes. Personal and sensitive information will be securely stored   in a digital database, minimizing security risks and ensuring easy retrieval and    management of data. The system will automatically verify the information            provided, reducing the time and effort required for manual verification by staff.

  2. Convenient Status Checking:

  Members will be able to check the status of their registration, loan                applications, and payments in real time through an online portal. The system will   automatically send email and SMS notifications to members regarding the status of   their applications and payments, ensuring timely and efficient communication.

  3. Enhanced Member Financial Statements

  Financial statements will be generated and distributed digitally, allowing          members to access their financial information anytime, anywhere. The system will    maintain comprehensive and up-to-date financial status, providing members with      detailed insights into their investments, loans, and other financial activities.

  4. Live Chat Features

  A live chat feature will be introduced, allowing users to comment and ask           questions at any time. This ensures they receive timely assistance and support.     The live chat will facilitate better communication between members and the          cooperative, addressing concerns and inquiries promptly.

  5. Secure Login Feature
 Each member and staff will have a unique username and password to ensure that      only authorized users can access the system and protect against external threats.  For instance, the system will enforce strong password policies, such as minimum    length, and complexity requirements. For instance, a mix of letters, numbers, and  special characters. In addition, we will incorporate Two-Factor Authentication     (2FA) to add a security level by requiring users to confirm their identity         through a secondary method like a one-time code sent to their mobile or email.     Furthermore, we will also provide secure account recovery choices, such as         security questions, and email or SMS verification to guarantee users can recover  access if they forget their login details. Lastly, session management functions    like auto logout after a period of inactivity and session timeouts will also be    introduced. This will boost security by preventing unauthorized access from        unattended devices and limiting the duration of user sessions.
