On 14 May 2024, Faculty of Computing UTM collaborated with Lembaga Kemajuan Pertanian Kemubu (KADA) to share information about the flow of their agency’s operations. The main objective of this industrial talk is to provide knowledge to students about the basic system requirements of a process. During the talk, Mr. Ahmad Rohailin bin Hani shared invaluable information with us regarding what their agency does and the intricacies of their agency’s internal processes, such as the member registration process and loan application process. The industrial talk session was conducted using a hybrid class method, with students in a room engaging with the interviewer through an online meeting. 

	The industrial talk gave us a lot of insights regarding how they manage their internal processes efficiently. It also gave us some ideas on ways to greatly improve the existing system of the agency which could potentially boost their productivity. Nonetheless, it was a short but meaningful experience as we got to communicate with Mr. Ahmad and learn more about the standard requirements for a system process, which is one of the main SDLC processes. This newfound knowledge will undoubtedly aid us in our future projects and professional development.
