## 4.0 Problem Statement

The registration system at KADA company is currently handled manually, showing signs of low efficiency and productivity, as described below. Even though it offers only a limited number of essential services and features, there is room for improvement. Recognizing the constraints of the existing system emphasizes the necessity for a complete overhaul to enhance the system. Moving towards a new system could greatly elevate their services and features. This new system will bring about automation, streamlined processes, an improved website for better performance, and an expanded array of services for users.

**1. Insufficient registration process**
In the current system, all registration procedures are manually processed, like customers filling out paper forms to register and staff handling each form individually. Personal information, both private and sensitive, is predominantly stored in hard copies during registration. This method not only poses security risks but also makes it challenging to retrieve or locate information when necessary. Additionally, the registration papers require further collection, rearrangement and scrutiny by staff at the end. It really takes much more time than doing the registration online.


**2. Inconvenient Status Checking**
In the existing process, members are unable to check the status directly, they must either call or wait for an email from the company to obtain the current status, whether it is about the registration approval or payment status. This method is not that convenient, as staff have to manually send emails instead of having an automated system on their website that segregates the status. Improvements are necessary to modernize this outdated system to enhance the efficiency of the processes.


**3. Heavy Dependence on Human Resources**
The existing manual system faces an issue as it heavily depends on human resources. All the steps starting from the registration and application for the loan are done manually. If the number of human resources decreases beyond a certain point, it will impact productivity and efficiency in the workplace. To address the issue of heavy dependence on human resources, the implementation of automation solutions is crucial as it can help streamline processes, minimise errors, and free up employees to focus on more strategic tasks that require human intervention.


**4. Inefficient and human error**
We know that retrieving and managing physical documents is time-consuming and the manual system heavily depends on human resources. This might lead to the chances of human error rising when staff forget to email the current status, missing payment receipts, or fail to gather customer information and also missing information. These inefficiencies will cause delays in service delivery and mistakes in data processing, affecting overall customer satisfaction and also might disrupt the entire development process as incomplete or inaccurate data may result. Therefore, the company requires a more well-designed system.


**5. Security Concerns of Manually Stored Customer Forms and Information**
In the digital age, safeguarding customer information is paramount for maintaining trust and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. The cooperative currently relies on manual storage of customer forms and information in physical cupboards. This method poses significant security risks that need urgent attention to protect sensitive data and uphold our commitment to customer privacy. As we can see, employees, cleaning staff, and visitors may easily access the cupboards, potentially leading to data breaches. Furthermore, it is challenging to track who accessed or modified the physical documents, making it difficult to audit and ensure the accountability of data handling practices.
